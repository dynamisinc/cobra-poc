///   Provides user information for audit trails and authorization.

/// FEMA Compliance:
///   All database mutations must track CreatedBy and CreatedByPosition
///   for audit compliance. This class provides that information.
///
/// Usage:
///   Injected into controllers via HttpContext.Items["UserContext"]
///   Services receive UserContext as method parameters
