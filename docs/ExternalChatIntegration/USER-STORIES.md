# External Messaging Integration - User Stories (v2)

## Epic: Unified Event Communications

**Epic ID Prefix:** UC (Unified Communications)

**Epic Description:** As a COBRA platform, I need to provide unified event communications through a channel-based architecture that supports both internal COBRA conversations and bi-directional integration with external messaging platforms (starting with GroupMe), ensuring emergency responders can communicate through their preferred tools while maintaining situational awareness and audit compliance.

**Business Value:** Emergency responders often use consumer messaging apps (GroupMe, WhatsApp, Signal, Teams) for quick coordination. This integration bridges the gap between informal field communication and COBRA's formal incident management, ensuring all communications are captured for situational awareness, after-action reviews, and FEMA compliance. The channel-based architecture prevents accidental disclosure of internal coordination to external parties while enabling seamless monitoring of all communication streams.

## Feature: Chat Administration

### UC-026: Chat Administration Dashboard

**Title:** Chat Administration Dashboard for Event Channels

**GitHub Issue:** #34

**As a** user with Manage permissions
**I want** a dedicated chat administration view for the event
**So that** I can manage all channels, view archived channels, restore channels, and perform administrative actions on messages

**Background:**

When users click on the Chat tool name in the breadcrumbs (rather than navigating to a specific channel), they should see an administration view instead of the default chat experience. This follows the C5 pattern where `/Events/{EventName}/Chat` shows the admin view and `/Events/{EventName}/Chat/Dashboard` shows the normal user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*Channel Overview Table*
- [ ] Display all active channels in a table with columns:
  - Channel name and type icon
  - Message count
  - Last message timestamp and sender
  - Connected external platform (if any) with platform icon
  - Actions menu
- [ ] Sort channels by display order (default) or by last activity
- [ ] Filter channels by type (Internal, Announcements, External, Custom)

*Channel Actions (Manage Permission Required)*
- [ ] Archive channel (except Announcements and default Event Chat)
- [ ] Archive all messages in a channel
- [ ] Archive messages older than a specified date/time
- [ ] Edit channel name and description
- [ ] View channel details (creation date, created by, message stats)

*Archived Channels View*
- [ ] Separate tab or section showing archived channels
- [ ] Display archived date and who archived it
- [ ] **Restore channel** - returns channel to active state
- [ ] **Permanent delete** - removes channel from event (data retained in DB, requires SQL to recover)
- [ ] Confirmation dialog for permanent delete with clear warning

*Navigation*
- [ ] Breadcrumb: Event > Chat shows admin view
- [ ] Breadcrumb: Event > Chat > Dashboard shows normal chat experience
- [ ] Quick navigation from admin view to specific channel
- [ ] "Back to Chat" button to return to Dashboard view

*Permissions*
- [ ] Read-only users can view channel list but not perform actions
- [ ] Manage permission required for archive, restore, delete, and edit operations
- [ ] All administrative actions are logged for audit

**Technical Notes:**

*Routes*
- `/events/:eventId/chat` → ChatAdminPage (administration view)
- `/events/:eventId/chat/dashboard` → ChatPage (normal user experience)

*Backend Endpoints Needed*
- `GET /api/events/{eventId}/chat/channels?includeArchived=true` - Get all channels including archived
- `POST /api/events/{eventId}/chat/channels/{channelId}/restore` - Restore archived channel
- `DELETE /api/events/{eventId}/chat/channels/{channelId}/permanent` - Permanent delete
- `POST /api/events/{eventId}/chat/channels/{channelId}/archive-messages` - Archive messages with optional date filter

*Components*
- `ChatAdminPage.tsx` - Main admin view with tabs
- `ChannelOverviewTable.tsx` - Active channels table
- `ArchivedChannelsTable.tsx` - Archived channels view
- `RestoreChannelDialog.tsx` - Confirmation for restore
- `PermanentDeleteDialog.tsx` - Warning dialog for permanent delete
- `ArchiveMessagesDialog.tsx` - Date picker for message archival

**Dependencies:** UC-004, UC-008

### UC-027: Unread Message Indicators

**Title:** Display unread message counts across all channels

**As a** COBRA user
**I want** to see unread message indicators on channels I haven't read
**So that** I know where new communications have arrived without checking each channel

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*Badge Display*
- [ ] Each channel shows an unread indicator (red dot) when unread messages exist
- [ ] Badge is visible on channel names in sidebar channel list
- [ ] Badge is visible on inactive tabs in full-page view
- [ ] Badge uses attention-drawing color (theme.palette.error)

*Section Aggregation (Sidebar)*
- [ ] Collapsed sections (Channels, External, Groups) show red dot if any child channel has unread messages
- [ ] Expanding a section shows individual channel indicators
- [ ] Section indicator updates in real-time as channels are read

*Read State Logic*
- [ ] Messages are marked as read when:
  - Channel accordion is expanded AND messages are visible in viewport for 2+ seconds (intersection observer)
  - Channel tab is active in full-page view AND messages are visible for 2+ seconds
  - User sends a message in the channel (implicit read)
- [ ] Read state is per-user (my unread state doesn't affect other users)
- [ ] Read state persists across sessions (stored server-side)

*Real-Time Updates*
- [ ] Indicators update via SignalR when new messages arrive in any channel
- [ ] Indicators clear when messages are marked as read
- [ ] Works across multiple browser tabs/windows for same user
- [ ] Other channels in sidebar list show indicators even when one channel is actively displayed

*Edge Cases*
- [ ] New channels start with 0 unread (user is "caught up" at creation)
- [ ] Archived channels don't show unread indicators
- [ ] External messages trigger indicators same as internal messages
- [ ] Reconnecting after offline marks messages received during disconnect as unread

**Dependencies:** UC-011, UC-012, UC-014

**Technical Notes:**

*Backend Changes*
- New table: `UserChannelReadState` (UserId, ChannelId, LastReadMessageId, LastReadAt)
- New endpoint: `POST /api/events/{eventId}/chat/channels/{channelId}/mark-read` - marks channel as read up to latest message
- New endpoint: `GET /api/events/{eventId}/chat/channels/unread-status` - returns unread status (boolean) per channel for user
- SignalR enhancement: Include `messageId` and `timestamp` in message broadcasts
- On user joining event SignalR group, send current unread status

*Frontend Changes*
- New hook: `useUnreadStatus()` - tracks unread boolean per channel via SignalR
- Intersection observer in expanded channel accordion for auto-mark-read (2s debounce)
- Red dot indicator component on channel names and collapsed section headers
- SignalR handler for setting unread=true on new messages in non-visible channels

*Database Schema*
```sql
CREATE TABLE UserChannelReadState (
    Id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT NEWSEQUENTIALID(),
    UserId NVARCHAR(450) NOT NULL,
    ChannelId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
    LastReadMessageId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NULL,
    LastReadAt DATETIME2 NOT NULL DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    CONSTRAINT FK_UserChannelReadState_Channel FOREIGN KEY (ChannelId)
        REFERENCES ChatThreads(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT UQ_UserChannelReadState UNIQUE (UserId, ChannelId)
);
CREATE INDEX IX_UserChannelReadState_UserId ON UserChannelReadState(UserId);
```

### Completed

| Story | Title | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| UC-001 | Auto-Create Default Channels | Complete: Backend auto-creates channels on event creation. Frontend ChannelList component displays channels in sidebar accordion. Announcements channel shows read-only message. Role-based write permission pending. |
| UC-005 | Create GroupMe Channel | Create new GroupMe group for event. Includes duplicate prevention and reconnect support. |
| UC-007 | Disconnect External Channel | Deactivate channel (soft delete). Reconnecting reactivates the same GroupMe group. |
| UC-009 | Receive External Messages | Webhook receives GroupMe messages and displays in COBRA via SignalR real-time. |
| UC-010 | Send Messages to External | COBRA messages in event chat are forwarded to linked GroupMe groups via bot. |
| UC-011 | Real-Time Updates | SignalR ChatHub provides real-time message delivery for both COBRA and external messages. |
| UC-012 | Channel Accordion Sidebar | **Partial** - Sidebar infrastructure complete (toggle, resize, persist). Full accordion channel list pending UC-001. |
| UC-014 | Full-Page Chat View | **Partial** - Resizable sidebar with EventChat. Tabbed channels pending UC-001. |
| UC-016 | External Message Visual Indicators | Platform icon badge on avatar, "(via Platform)" suffix, platform-colored avatars. Sidebar/tab icons pending UC-001. |

### Implementation Details

#### Channel Architecture (UC-001)

**Backend Files Created:**
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Services/IChannelService.cs` - Interface for channel management operations
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Services/ChannelService.cs` - Full implementation with CRUD operations
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Models/Entities/ChannelType.cs` - Enum: Internal, Announcements, External, Position, Custom

**Backend Files Modified:**
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Models/Entities/ChatThread.cs` - Added channel fields (ChannelType, Description, DisplayOrder, IconName, Color, ExternalChannelMappingId)
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Models/DTOs/ChatDTOs.cs` - Added UpdateChannelRequest DTO, extended ChatThreadDto
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Controllers/ChatController.cs` - Added 6 channel endpoints (CRUD + reorder)
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Shared/Events/Services/EventService.cs` - Calls CreateDefaultChannelsAsync after event creation
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Core/Data/CobraDbContext.cs` - Added ChatThread channel field configurations
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Program.cs` - Registered IChannelService

**Frontend Files Created:**
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/components/ChannelList.tsx` - Accordion-style channel list with sections for Internal, External, and Custom channels

**Frontend Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/types/chat.ts` - Extended ChatThreadDto, added CreateChannelRequest/UpdateChannelRequest interfaces
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/services/chatService.ts` - Added 6 channel API methods
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/components/ChatSidebar.tsx` - Added channel list view with channel selection and back navigation
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/components/EventChat.tsx` - Added channelId/channelType props, read-only check for Announcements
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/components/index.ts` - Export ChannelList component

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Default channels created: "Event Chat" (Internal, DisplayOrder=0, icon=comments) and "Announcements" (Announcements type, DisplayOrder=1, icon=bullhorn)
- ChannelType enum values: Internal=0, Announcements=1, External=2, Position=3, Custom=4
- DeleteChannelAsync prevents deletion of default event channel (IsDefaultEventThread=true) and External channels
- ReorderChannelsAsync updates DisplayOrder based on ordered list of channel IDs

#### GroupMe Integration (UC-005, UC-007, UC-009, UC-010, UC-022, UC-023, UC-024)

**Backend Files Created:**
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Controllers/WebhooksController.cs` - Receives GroupMe webhooks
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Controllers/ExternalChannelsController.cs` - Channel management API
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Services/ExternalMessagingService.cs` - Channel lifecycle and message routing
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Services/ChatHubService.cs` - SignalR broadcast service
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/ExternalPlatforms/GroupMeApiClient.cs` - GroupMe API client
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Hubs/ChatHub.cs` - SignalR hub for real-time chat

**Frontend Files Created:**
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/hooks/useChatHub.ts` - SignalR connection hook for real-time updates
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/components/EventChat.tsx` - Main chat UI with external channel support
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/components/ChatMessage.tsx` - Message rendering with external indicators

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Webhook endpoint returns 200 immediately, processes message in background `Task.Run()` with new DI scope
- Outbound messages to GroupMe also use `Task.Run()` with new DI scope to avoid DbContext disposal issues
- Duplicate channel prevention: Returns existing active channel or reactivates deactivated channel
- SignalR uses event-specific groups (`event-{eventId}`) for scoped real-time updates
- React Strict Mode handling: Reset connection refs on cleanup for proper remount behavior

#### External Message Visual Indicators (UC-016)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/types/chat.ts` - Extended `PlatformInfo` with icons, added `ChannelType` enum and `ChannelDisplayInfo` interface for future extensibility
- `src/frontend/src/tools/chat/components/ChatMessage.tsx` - Added platform icon badge overlay on avatar for external messages

**Features Implemented:**
- Platform icon badge on avatar (colored circle with icon in bottom-right corner)
- Platform-specific icons: GroupMe (comment-dots), Signal (comment-sms), Teams (Microsoft brand), Slack (Slack brand)
- Platform-colored avatars for external messages
- "(via Platform)" text suffix in message header
- Tooltip distinguishing "External user via {Platform}" vs "COBRA user"
- `ChannelType` enum for future channel types (Internal, Announcements, External, Position, Custom)
- `ChannelDisplayInfo` interface for sidebar/tabs (ready for UC-001)

**Dependencies Added:**
