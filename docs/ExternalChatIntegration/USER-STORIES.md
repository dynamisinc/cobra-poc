# External Messaging Integration - User Stories (v2)

## Epic: Unified Event Communications

**Epic ID Prefix:** UC (Unified Communications)

**Epic Description:** As a COBRA platform, I need to provide unified event communications through a channel-based architecture that supports both internal COBRA conversations and bi-directional integration with external messaging platforms (starting with GroupMe), ensuring emergency responders can communicate through their preferred tools while maintaining situational awareness and audit compliance.

**Business Value:** Emergency responders often use consumer messaging apps (GroupMe, WhatsApp, Signal, Teams) for quick coordination. This integration bridges the gap between informal field communication and COBRA's formal incident management, ensuring all communications are captured for situational awareness, after-action reviews, and FEMA compliance. The channel-based architecture prevents accidental disclosure of internal coordination to external parties while enabling seamless monitoring of all communication streams.

- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Models/DTOs/ChatDTOs.cs` - Added UpdateChannelRequest DTO, extended ChatThreadDto
- `src/backend/CobraAPI/Tools/Chat/Controllers/ChatController.cs` - Added 6 channel endpoints (CRUD + reorder)

- ChannelType enum values: Internal=0, Announcements=1, External=2, Position=3, Custom=4
- DeleteChannelAsync prevents deletion of default event channel (IsDefaultEventThread=true) and External channels
- ReorderChannelsAsync updates DisplayOrder based on ordered list of channel IDs

#### GroupMe Integration (UC-005, UC-007, UC-009, UC-010, UC-022, UC-023, UC-024)
